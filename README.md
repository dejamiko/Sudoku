# Sudoku

This project is my take on sudoku.

I started with a sudoku solver and that quickly made me want to implement a graphical user interface. I then proceeded
with adding a generator, which utilises the solver to generate solvable boards. I also added functionality to
my gui to make it possible for a human player to play the game.
